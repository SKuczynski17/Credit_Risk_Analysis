# Samuel Kuczynski Credit Risk Analysis

### Overview of Project

#### Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Jill and I worked together to build up skills in the following that allowed us to tackle creating multiple machine learning models using different strategies to help provide us the best solution.

### Deliverables

#### There were 3 main objectives we attacked during this task.
    - Use our resampling models to predict credit risk
    - Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to predict credit risk
    - Use Ensemble Classifiers to predict credit risk

### Results
